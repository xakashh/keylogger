#dArk doDDer Project
A dark project for our dark works, used to catch everything the host types, the passwords, the chats, the everything the host types. 

We are the Serial-Coders, make the dArk-doDDer, this project has the capability to run in background and will appeal as if it is just a stupid Internet booster, but it does not boosts the net, instead it gets what the user types, it works on linux and works as soon as the PC is booted and will send the data to the doDDer **head-quaters;**
